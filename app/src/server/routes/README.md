# Wiring requests for the routers in this directory

The boot file (`src/server/index.ts`) belongs to the Platform engineer;
routers here are mounted by request, never by their authors (shared
protocol, section 3). This file is where those requests live, the same
convention as `src/server/auth/README.md` at P1. `health.ts` is Platform's
own and already mounted; entries below concern the rest.

## folders router (P2, Collaboration and Permissions)

Requested wiring, one line in createApp, after the auth router's mount and
ahead of the `/api` catch-all:

```ts
import { createFoldersRouter } from './routes/folders.js'

app.use('/api/v1', createFoldersRouter({ dbClient: options.dbClient }))
```

Facts the wiring can rely on:

- The factory is synchronous, performs no I/O, and opens no database
  (11.10's createApp discipline carried through). With no dbClient, every
  data route answers the constructed-without-a-database 500, the auth
  router's convention, so route-presence probes still work.
- The router attaches its own session middleware and steps aside when the
  auth router's already ran on the request, so it is order-tolerant; the
  order above is still the one to prefer, because it resolves each
  request's session exactly once.
- The share-grant call site reaches the notify module through
  notifierOf(req.app), which createApp already attaches; no further
  wiring is needed for it.
- Mounting this router is what turns AC-011 to AC-024 green; nothing else
  is owed by the boot file for P2.
